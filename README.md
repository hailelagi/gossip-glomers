## status
still working through 'em! somewhere in between a descent broadcast algorithm and CRDTs

## Installation

There should be a `run.sh` script which expects a maelstrom binary to be downloaded in root at `maelstrom/maelstrom`.

```zsh
run.sh
```

don't forget to ask nicely, the script doesn't do anything interesting:

```zsh
chmod +x ./path/run.sh
```
